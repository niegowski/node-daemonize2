Node module for easy creation of daemons for Node 0.8.x

For Node 0.6.x compatibility see daemonize https://github.com/niegowski/node-daemonize

Just write your daemon as plain node.js application 
(like `/examples/simple/app.js`) and a simple controller with Daemonize 
(like `/examples/simple/ctrl.js`). 


Installation
==============
```
$ npm install daemonize
```


Example
=========

``` js
var daemon = require("daemonize2").setup({
    main: "app.js",
    name: "sampleapp",
    pidfile: "sampleapp.pid"
});

switch (process.argv[2]) {
    
    case "start": 
        daemon.start();
        break;
    
    case "stop":
        daemon.stop();
        break;
    
    default:
        console.log("Usage: [start|stop]");
}
```

For more examples see `examples` folder.

Documentation
===============

Daemonize works like standard `require()` but loaded module is 
forked to work in background as a daemon. 

Keep in mind that `stdin`, `stdout` and `stderr` are redirected 
to `/dev/null` so any output from daemon won't display in console. 
You need to use file for logging (ie like `/examples/advanced/app.js`).

Also any uncaught exception won't be displayed in the console,
so `process.on("uncaughtException", ...)` should be used to
redirect output to some log file.

## daemonize.setup(options)
Creates new `Daemon` instance. Supported `options`:

* `main` - main application module file to run as daemon (required)
* `name` - daemon name (default: basename of main)
* `pidfile` - pidfile path (default: `/var/run/[name].pid`)
* `user` - name or id of user (default: current)
* `group` - name or id of group (default: current)
* `silent` - disable printing info to console (default: `false`)
* `stopTimeout` - interval of daemon killing retry (default: `2s`)

All paths are resolved relative to file that uses "daemonize".

All commandline arguments will be passed to the child process.

## Daemon
Daemon control class. It references controlled daemon.

### Event: "starting"
`function() { }`

Emitted when `start()` is called and if daemon is not already running.

### Event: "started"
`function(pid) { }`

Emitted when daemon successfully started after calling `start()`.

### Event: "running"
`function(pid) { }`

Emitted when `start()` is called and a daemon is already running.

### Event: "stopping"
`function() { }`

Emitted when `stop()` or `kill()` is called and a daemon is running.

### Event: "stopped"
`function(pid) { }`

Emitted when daemon was successfully stopped after calling `stop()` 
or `kill()`.

### Event: "notrunning"
`function() { }`

Emitted when `stop()` or `kill()` is called and a deamon is not running.

### Event: "error"
`function(error) { }`

Emitted when `start()` failed. `error` is instance of `Error`. 
`error.message` contains information what went wrong.

### daemon.start()
Start daemon asynchronously. Emits `running` in case when daemon is 
already running and `starting` when daemon is not running. Then emits 
`started` when daemon is successfully started. 

Emits `error` in case of any problem during daemon startup.

### daemon.stop()
Asynchronously stop daemon. Sends `SIGTERM` to daemon every 2s (or time 
set in options). 

Emits `notrunning` when daemon is not running, otherwise 
emits `stopping` and then `stopped` when daemon successfully stopped. 

### daemon.kill()
Kill daemon asynchronously. Sends `SIGTERM` and after 2s `SIGKILL` to the 
child if needed. Repeats sending `SIGKILL` every 2s untill daemon 
stops (interval can be changed in options).

Emits events same as `stop()`.

### daemon.status()
Synchronously returns pid for running daemon or 0 when daemon is not running.

### daemon.sendSignal(signal)
Synchronously sends `signal` to daemon and returns pid of daemon or 0 when
daemon is not running.
